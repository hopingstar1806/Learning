      The <span> element, on the other hand, can be used
      to group inline elements only. So, if you have a
      part of a sentence or paragraph which you want to
      group together, you could use the <span> element as
      follows.
    -->
        <p>This is the example of <span style = "color:green">span tag</span>
           and the <span style = "color:red">div tag</span> alongwith CSS</p>
